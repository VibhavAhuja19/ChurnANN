## üìã Overview

This application uses a trained deep learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a service (churn) based on demographic and account information. The model analyzes factors such as:

- Credit score
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Account balance
- Estimated salary
- Tenure
- Number of products
- Credit card status
- Active member status

The application provides a churn probability estimate to help businesses identify at-risk customers.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for seamless user experience
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant churn probability calculations
- **Comprehensive Input Options**:
  - Geography (Country selection)
  - Gender (Male/Female)
  - Age (Slider input)
  - Account balance
  - Credit score
  - Estimated salary
  - Tenure (Years with company)
  - Number of products
  - Credit card status (Yes/No)
  - Active member status (Yes/No)
- **Visual Prediction Results**: Clear output with probability percentage
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Suggestions based on prediction results
